🎨 Visual hierarchy

Annual plan visually leads

Monthly looks fair

Free looks safe but boring

CTA buttons are full width and thumb reachable

Use one accent color, not unicorn vomit

🧪 Micro-interactions (important)

selecting a card slightly bounces

default preselected = Annual Pro

when they switch, price equivalence updates smoothly

confetti? No. You’re not a slot machine.

🛑 Anti-annoyance rules

Do NOT:

hide the free option

grey out the X

trap them in pricing before trying the app

do countdown timers unless you’re selling socks on TikTok

Let the product do the convincing.

“Most Popular” badge vs “Best for families”

$59/year vs $69/year with bigger discount claim

annual plan default vs monthly default

Humans are weird. Measure, don’t guess.
