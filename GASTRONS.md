Gastrons – Landing Page Design Guidelines
Document purpose

This document defines the visual and UX guidelines for the initial coming-soon landing page for the Gastrons app. It should be clear, minimal, visually driven, and focused on early-access signups. If it starts to look like a Vegas buffet of gradients, something has gone wrong.

1. Page goals

Primary goals:

explain the core concept in under 5 seconds

visually showcase the parchment-style recipe layout

collect emails for early access

communicate the two core product ideas

visual recipes

convert screenshots into our format

Secondary goals:

establish brand identity

make the app feel simple, friendly, non-pretentious

not look like every food blog on the internet

2. Audience assumptions

Design should feel natural and usable for:

visual learners

beginners in the kitchen

busy adults who don’t want to read paragraphs

parents cooking with kids

neurodivergent users who prefer structured visual info

This is not a gourmet chef brand. It’s clarity over fancy plating.

3. Tone & personality

The landing page should feel:

visual-first

approachable

calm

modern

slightly playful without being childish

Avoid:

loud “food influencer” aesthetics

heavy cursive fonts

cluttered backgrounds

text-heavy blocks

If something looks like a food blog that starts with someone’s childhood story about soup, delete it.

4. Layout structure (high level)

The landing page should be a single scroll experience with these sections:

Hero section with headline and call to action

Large featured parchment-style recipe image

“How it works” three-step explanation

Core feature highlights

Email capture section

Footer with brand and basic info

Keep everything breathable with generous spacing.

5. Visual style
Color palette

Primary palette should be neutral and food-supporting, not dominant:

parchment off-white

soft beige

warm light gray

black for line art

optional muted accent green or brown

Food should be the only saturated color on the page.

Avoid neon colors. This isn’t a nightclub.

Imagery style

Use top-down flat-lay photography wherever possible.

Guidelines:

parchment-style recipe sheet centered

ingredients clearly separated

minimal props

natural light look, soft shadows

avoid greasy or messy food presentation

The parchment recipe layout is the hero. Everything else supports it.

Iconography

thin line art

Ikea-style simplicity

consistent stroke weight

rounded corners instead of sharp industrial edges

Icons needed:

clock

oven

checkmark

photo/screenshot

upload

print

ingredients

6. Typography

Primary font style: geometric or humanist sans-serif

Recommended examples:

Inter

Poppins

Avenir Next

DM Sans

Rules:

bold for key headings

regular or medium for body text

avoid serif for primary content

absolutely no script fonts

Readability beats personality every time.

7. Hero section guidelines
Content elements:

app/product name

short headline

single-sentence value proposition

CTA button for early access

supporting parchment-style recipe image

Visual composition:

hero image should be large and centered or right-aligned

use white/neutral space around it

CTA should be visually obvious but not visually aggressive

Headline guidelines:

max 2 lines

avoid marketing fluff

avoid chef clichés

Example tone:

Turn any recipe into a simple visual page you can follow at a glance.

8. Parchment recipe showcase section

This is the signature visual.

Must include:

parchment-style recipe layout screenshot

visible ingredient icons or outlines

small supporting description text

“as-seen-in-app” feeling

Presentation:

single large image

clean drop shadow

centered on neutral background

Optional supportive elements:

floating ingredient elements

subtle motion/parallax allowed

no fake 3D nonsense

9. “How it works” section

Three-step layout using cards or columns:

Upload or screenshot a recipe

App converts it into our visual layout

User cooks using visual step-by-step sheet

Each step includes:

minimal text (1–2 short sentences)

one clear icon or illustration

consistent spacing and sizing

Avoid paragraphs. People do not read them.

10. Feature highlights section

Use 3–4 cards max.

Example features:

✔️ check off ingredients and steps

📸 convert recipe screenshots

🗂 visual recipe library

🖨 printable layouts

Design rules:

icons above text

equal card width

no gradients

light neutral background blocks

11. Email capture section

Structure:

single input field

“Notify me” style CTA button

privacy reassurance line below

Design:

centered

large, simple, non-threatening

does not scream “lead generation form”

No unnecessary fields. Email only.

12. Footer

Content:

brand name

one-line description

“Launching soon” text

minimal legal placeholders

Design tone:

quiet

not dense

enough padding

13. Accessibility guidelines

text must meet WCAG contrast

buttons minimum 44px height

avoid tiny light-gray text

do not rely on color alone for meaning

icons must be understandable without labels

This app is literally about clarity. The landing page must live up to that.

14. Motion / interaction guidance

Allow:

soft hover states

slight parallax on parchment image

button micro-animations

Avoid:

autoplay video

background animations

constant movement

distracting scroll hijacking

The experience should feel calm.

15. What to absolutely avoid

food blogger aesthetic clutter

autoplay hero video

dark edgy color schemes

twelve different fonts

recipe text walls

intrusive pop-ups

If it looks like marketing aggressively trying to prove something, tone it down.
